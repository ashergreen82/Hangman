## **Summary**

<pre>
Looking for projects to work on, I found a website that had a nice list of projects and one of them was Hangman.  This brought back memories, because back when I was young, Hangman was one of hte classic favourits we used to play on those
old 8 bit computers.

One of the most important lessons I learned while programming this was file manipulation.  The game uses a large file I donwloaded off the internet which contains over 200,000 words to choose from.  So I had to access the file and select one of the words from the file and use that as the word the player has to guess.

I also wrote the program using the object oriented model of programming which is new to me.  I had never programmed in OOP before and this was a great learning opportunity.

Enjoy!
